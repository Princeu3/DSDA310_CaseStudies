- **Findings**:
  - English proficiency positively impacts academic achievement.
  - Special education students face significant challenges.
  - Families new to Beloit experience transitional difficulties affecting performance.
- **Models**: Linear regression validate the significance of these variables.

### Policy Recommendations
1. **Enhance Special Education Programs**: Increase resources, specialized staff, and adaptive materials.
2. **English Language Support**: Implement comprehensive English Language Development Programs.
3. **Community Integration**: Initiate orientation sessions and mentorship for new families.

## Case Study 2: YouTube Analytics for Client Engagement

### Overview
This case study analyzes YouTube channel performance for Nicole Martin Consulting Group to enhance client engagement and highlight growth potential. By examining data from YouTube Studio for January to April in consecutive years, we identified patterns in viewer behavior, engagement, and traffic sources.

### Contents

#### 1. **Report**
   - **Files**:
     - `Case_Study_2_Report.pdf`
   - **Description**: Comprehensive analysis detailing key metrics, trends, and actionable recommendations for improving channel performance. The report tells a "story of strength" to emphasize growth and potential ROI for stakeholders.

#### 2. **Slides**
   - **Files**: `CS_2_Slides.pdf`
   - **Description**: Presentation summarizing results, focusing on metrics like impressions, views, and audience engagement. Includes visually compelling slides for stakeholder communication.

#### 3. **Data**
   - **Files**: `Compiled Data formatted.xlsx`
   - **Description**: Dataset containing YouTube Studio metrics such as impressions, views, CTR, watch time, and audience demographics. Formatted for analysis without additional cleaning.

### Key Insights
- **Performance Metrics**
  - Total views grew by 1.5% year-over-year.
  - Impressions increased by 26%, driven by browse features and YouTube's algorithm.
  - Unique viewers decreased due to seasonal content gaps, highlighting the need for year-round engagement strategies.
    
- **Audience Insights:**
  - Male viewers dominate the audience (73%) but female viewers show higher engagement per session.
  - Notifications boosted views by 150%, emphasizing the importance of subscriber alerts.

### Recommendations
1. Increase off-season postings like behind-the-scenes videos and sneak peeks to maintain viewer interest.
2. Optimize thumbnails and keywords for better CTR and search visibility.
3. Leverage returning viewers with personalized content and notifications.

### Acknowledgments

We thank Nicole Martin for providing data and Prof Disha for guidance throughout this analysis. The structured data enabled a seamless workflow.

## Case Study 3: EEG Signal Detection Using CNNs

### Overview
This case study focuses on developing and applying Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for detecting seizures using EEG data in Bonn Dataset. It highlights the use of machine learning to automate seizure detection and provides insights into neurological disorders.

### Contents

#### 1. **Report**
   - **Files**:
     - `Case_Study_3_Report.pdf`
     - `CS_3_Slides.pdf`
   - **Description**:
     - Detailed report and presentation on the methodology, including data preprocessing, CNN architecture, and results. Insights into model accuracy and clinical applicability are discussed.
       
#### 2. **Code**
   - **Files**: `CS_3_Code.ipynb`
   - **Description**: Jupyter Notebook implementing the CNN model, with steps for preprocessing, training, and evaluating EEG signal data.

### 3. **Data**: 
   - **Files**:
   - **Description**: The study uses the Bonn EEG dataset, containing 500 full signals (400 seizures, 100 non-seizures) and 11,500 short signals (2,300 seizures, 9,200 non-seizures).

### Key Insights
- **Performance Metrics**
   - Achieved 99% accuracy for short signals and 90% accuracy for full signals.
   - High accuracy in detecting seizure patterns validates CNN effectiveness for clean, structured data.
    
- **Challenges:**
   - Full signal accuracy was lower due to limited data.
   - Future testing on noisy, real-world data is recommended.

### Recommendations
1. Fine-tune CNN parameters for better accuracy on full signals.
2. Test model on noisy datasets and real-world scenarios.
3. Develop user-friendly interfaces for medical professionals.

### Acknowledgments

Data for this project was provided by Dr. Rachel Bergstrom. We express gratitude for her guidance and support.
